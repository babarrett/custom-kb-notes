#### Mapping the shift key to another layer, rather than having it sent a modifier.
* By: https://www.reddit.com/user/fullyassociative
* July 15, 2017. Reddit
* using the macro LT(layer, kc); It doesn't act as shift but rather a layer with the letter keys shifted.
* This gives me the freedom to program other keys for other stuff like making backspace forward delete.
* Generates "space" if tapped.

#### Mac QMK development w/o "brew"
* use Docker
* I'm on a Mac, and I just use the docker image. Works great, no env setup required...
* ...the downside is that you need to be comfortable with docker.
* You could look at the homebrew scripts for the AVR toolchain to see what they
do to build it: https://github.com/osx-cross/homebrew-avr

#### Mitosis HW expansion
* A RTTS 3.5mm cable to connect to (up to 3) foot peddles. Add to main kbd PCB.
* Additional wireless numeric pad
* Additional wireless macro pad (could be same HW/SW as the numeric pad.)
